## Design Principles Workshop
There are universal principles that apply to everyone. These are important. However your principles should be unique to your team, product and goals. Your objective is to find unique attributes that inform your work.

### Planning
* Plan your workshop well ahead of the start of a project.
* Decide on who should be involved in the workshop. Don't make the group too big but ensure the key decision-makers are present.
* Explain the purpose of the workshop in advance and set a clear agenda. Ask your team to take a look at the [examples](/examples) on this site before the workshop.
* Ensure the key people required are invited and able to attend.
