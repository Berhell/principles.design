title: Worse is better
author: Richard P. Gabriel
overview: It is the idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionalityâ€”that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

principles:
- principle: Simplicity
  summary: The design must be simple, both interface and implementation, but prefer simple implementations over simple interfaces.
- principle: Correctness
  summary: The design must be correct in all aspects, but prefer simplicity over being correct.
- principle: Consistency
  summary: The design should follow the project's guidelines. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but prefer removing parts of the design that will not be often used over introdudcing either complexity and incosistency.
- principle: Completeness
  summary: The design must cover as many important situations as possible, but prefer any other quality above over addressing all use cases.
